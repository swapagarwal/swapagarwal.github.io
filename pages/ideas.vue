        <h2>I 🧞 wish there existed:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A chrome extension to limit infinite scroll on social media to reduce content addiction!
            </li>
            <li>
                A gym that increases your monthly fee based on how frequently you go.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cosplay for hospitals; we need more of that!
            </li>
            <li>
                Generic caching proxy as a service (for using as a wrapper over rate-limited APIs).
            </li>
        </ul>
        Let me know if you end up making one of these / know that it exists already. I'll be quite thankful! 🙏
